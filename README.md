## My interest in IT
Interest in IT developed few years ago due to my brother being in IT, but I did not learn further than required. It is just my general curiosity to know some basic programming and other aspects of IT.

I was accepted into RMIT to learn introductory programming though I am not progressing well to the extent I'd like to.

I expect to learn new concepts and developments in this field.
